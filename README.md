**Your own Call of Duty 2 server, still.** CoD2rev-Plus is the Call of Duty 2 multiplayer dedicated server rebuilt from its source, for versions 1.0 and 1.3, on Windows and Linux. Players join it with the game they already have, and it fixes many bugs of the original server and adds what server admins and modders have been missing.

It is a fork of [voron00/CoD2rev_Server](https://github.com/voron00/CoD2rev_Server), where the reverse-engineering of the server was done.

## What it does today

- **Builds for Windows and Linux:** a MinGW build for Windows, `make` for 64-bit Linux, the game version (1.0 or 1.3) chosen at build time, automated builds on every push, launchers and an example `server.cfg`.
- **Security and stability:** network input that crashed the server or overwrote its memory is now bounds-checked; rcon locks out IPs after wrong passwords; downloads can't fetch the stock game files; IP bans are enforced; and a crash leaves a report in `crash.log`.
- **Compatibility:** large messages from 1.3 clients, Game Pass clients, master servers given as `host:port`, `dedicated 1`, game files on Windows drives under WSL, a steady game clock, and bots that come back after a map change.
- **Administration:** passwords kept out of the log, log naming, rotation and timestamps, a forced rate and snapshot rate, a configurable CD key authorization server, optional kick and timeout messages, a clean shutdown on SIGTERM and a systemd unit.
- **Scripting (libcod):** most of [zk_libcod](https://github.com/ibuddieat/zk_libcod)'s script functions and callbacks, with the same names: script errors with file and line, button presses, rcon commands, player and weapon control, admin tools, waypoint graphs with A\*, what each player sees, hears and collides with, physics, JSON, HTTP and WebSocket clients, sounds through voice chat and more, fixing several of its bugs on the way.
- **Bots mod:** `mods/bots`, bots that find their way over waypoint graphs, use sights, grenades and knives, and play the SD, CTF and HQ objectives.
- **Tests:** a smoke test with a minimal client that reads the server's snapshots, and a bots test that play real maps.

It also runs the local games of [OpenCoD2-Plus](https://github.com/JotaJazz/OpenCoD2-Plus), a rebuilt CoD2 client. Every change in detail, with its functions, variables and fixes, is in [docs/CHANGES.md](docs/CHANGES.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Still being improved.** If something breaks or behaves differently from the original server, please report it in the [issues](https://github.com/JotaJazz/CoD2rev-Plus/issues).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No game files are included.** This repository is source code only. The server needs the `main` folder with the `.iwd` files from a copy of Call of Duty 2 that **you own**.

## How to run

Ready-to-run builds will be published on the **Releases** page. Until then, build the server (see [Building](#building)) and copy it into your Call of Duty 2 folder, next to `main`, with a `server.cfg` in `main` ([`scripts/server.cfg.example`](scripts/server.cfg.example) is a good start).

**Windows:** copy `cod2rev_win32.exe` and [`scripts/windows/iniciar_cod2rev.bat`](scripts/windows/iniciar_cod2rev.bat), then run:

```bat
iniciar_cod2rev.bat            :: LAN or direct IP
iniciar_cod2rev.bat internet   :: also on the public server list
```

**Linux:** copy `cod2rev_lnxded` and [`scripts/linux/iniciar_cod2rev.sh`](scripts/linux/iniciar_cod2rev.sh), then run:

```sh
./iniciar_cod2rev.sh            # LAN or direct IP
./iniciar_cod2rev.sh internet   # also on the public server list
```

Both start on port `28960` with the map `mp_toujane`. If the game also runs on the same PC, start the server first: the game uses `28960` too. More options, CD key checks and systemd are in [Running](#running).

## Game versions

- **The version is chosen when building.** By default the server is built as 1.0 (protocol 115); with `PROTOCOL=118` it is built as 1.3. The server announces that version to the master servers, so it shows up in the server list of clients of that same version.
- **The 1.0 build also accepts other versions by direct IP.** With libcod, which is enabled by default, it accepts connections using protocols 115 to 119, which includes 1.3 (protocol 118) and the Game Pass version (protocol 119). Direct IP connections to this build have been tested, including with a CoD2x 1.4.x client.
- **The 1.3 build only accepts protocol 118 clients.** It has been started on Linux and Windows, where it loads a map and answers as 1.3, and the Linux build has been played on with a CoD2x 1.4 client. [CoD2x](https://github.com/callofduty2x/CoD2x) 1.4 clients also connect with protocol 118, and their server browser only lists servers that report protocol 118 or 120, so this is the build they can see.

## For contributors

Every kind of help counts: running a server and reporting what goes wrong, testing on other systems, mods that use the new script functions, or code. The technical documentation, in English, starts at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md); [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the entry point for AI coding agents.

## Building

The output goes to `bin/` and intermediate objects to `obj/`.

### Linux

The server is a 64-bit binary by default and needs only `gcc` and `g++`. `make ARCH=x86` builds a 32-bit one, which on a 64-bit system needs GCC's 32-bit support (on Debian and Ubuntu, the `gcc-multilib` and `g++-multilib` packages):

```bash
make                 # 1.0 -> bin/cod2rev_lnxded
make PROTOCOL=118    # 1.3, same name
```

### Windows (cross-compiled from Linux with MinGW)

Requires the 32-bit MinGW-w64 compiler with POSIX threads (on Debian and Ubuntu, `gcc-mingw-w64-i686-posix` and `g++-mingw-w64-i686-posix`):

```bash
make windows                 # 1.0 -> bin/cod2rev_win32.exe
make windows PROTOCOL=118    # 1.3, same name
```

<details>
<summary><b>Game version, automated builds and Makefile options</b></summary>

Without `PROTOCOL`, or with `PROTOCOL=115`, the server is built as 1.0. Each platform and version keeps its own objects under `obj/`, so you can switch between them without `make clean`; both versions write the same file name, and `BIN_DIR=<folder>` builds into another folder to keep both.

Every push to `master` that changes the code builds both versions for both platforms on GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)). The resulting binaries can be downloaded as artifacts from the repository's [Actions](https://github.com/JotaJazz/CoD2rev-Plus/actions) tab.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WITH_LIBCOD` | `true` | Includes the libcod script extensions (bots, players, entities, weapons, utilities, etc.). |
| `WITH_SQLITE` | `true` | Script functions for SQLite. |
| `WITH_MYSQL` | `false` | Script functions for MySQL. Requires the MySQL client library. |
| `WITH_SPEEX` | `true` | `loadSoundFile`, `playSoundFile` and the other sound functions, with Speex (`src/libcod/speex`). |
| `WITH_HTTP` | `true` | `httpFetch` and `webSocket*`, with Mbed TLS (`src/libcod/mbedtls`) for `https://` and `wss://`. |

`make clean` removes the binary and the objects.

## Running

<details>
<summary><b>Launchers, CD key authorization and systemd</b></summary>

The launchers start in LAN mode by default (`dedicated 1`: LAN or direct IP); with `internet` they announce the server on the public list (`dedicated 2`). They set their values before `+exec server.cfg`, so `server.cfg` can change them. If the game is already running on the same PC, a server started after it moves to the next free port.

**Key authorization:** the server queries `cod2master.activision.com` to validate the key of every client that is not on the local network. With `sv_cracked 1` it still sends the query, but accepts the client whatever the answer is. The launchers only turn it on in LAN mode; in internet mode a valid key is required unless `server.cfg` turns it on.

**systemd:** `scripts/linux/cod2rev@.service` runs servers under systemd, one per instance: `systemctl enable --now cod2rev@public` runs `public.cfg` with its own home folder in `/var/lib/cod2rev/public`, restarts the server if it crashes and stops it cleanly with SIGTERM (final message, flatline heartbeat, logs closed). The comments in the file explain how to install it.

`run_bin.sh` is the original project's test script: it starts `bin/cod2rev_lnxded` in developer mode with cheats enabled and test bots. It is useful as an example of parameters, not as a configuration for a real server.

## Testing

<details>
<summary><b>The test scripts</b></summary>

`scripts/smoke_test.py` needs a built server and a game folder:

```bash
python3 scripts/smoke_test.py /path/to/CoD2
make PROTOCOL=118 && python3 scripts/smoke_test.py /path/to/CoD2 --protocol 118
```

It starts the server in LAN mode with a temporary home folder, so the game folder is only read. It checks that the server loads a map and answers `getinfo`, `getstatus` and rcon, and that `scripts/cod2client.py`, a minimal client, can connect, receive the gamestate, enter the game and send commands, including a message split into fragments. Use a game folder with the stock `.iwd` files: mods in `main` that replace the gametype scripts can stop the map from loading.

`scripts/bots_test.py` installs the bots mod in a temporary folder, plays a map with six bots and checks that the waypoint graph is built, saved and read back, that the bots follow paths and use sights, grenades and knives, and that no script error occurs:

```bash
python3 scripts/bots_test.py /path/to/CoD2 --map mp_carentan
```

With `--gametype sd` or `--gametype ctf` it checks instead that the bots plant the bomb or pick up the enemy flag. `--bombmode 1` plays SD in single bomb mode, with one bomb site. `--corrupt-cache` starts from a damaged waypoint file, which the bots must replace with a new graph.

`scripts/http_test.py` checks `httpFetch` and `webSocket*` against local HTTP, HTTPS, WS and WSS servers, and `scripts/check_docs.py` checks the documentation's links and paths.

To look for memory errors, build the server with AddressSanitizer in a separate folder and pass that binary with `--binary`:

```bash
make OBJ_ROOT=/tmp/asan/obj BIN_DIR=/tmp/asan/bin \
  CFLAGS="-fno-pie -O1 -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mfpmath=387 -DNDEBUG -DPROTOCOL_VERSION=115 -MMD -MP -m64 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -fsanitize=address" \
  LFLAGS="-no-pie -m64 -fsanitize=address"
```

`CFLAGS` given on the command line replaces the Makefile's, so `-m64` and `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64` must be repeated. Running that build for a while with the bots mod and a short `sv_mapRotation` also covers map changes and gameplay.

## Transparency

- **Who maintains this:** I'm JotaJazz. I like old games, and that is why this fork exists: I want to keep being able to run a CoD2 server on my own machines.
- **How the work is done:** I work with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's coding assistant. The changes in this fork, including this README and its translations, are written with its help. Commits made this way carry a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` line in their message, so they can be identified in the history with `git log`.
- **Relationship with the original:** this fork pulls changes from the original repository when there are any, but does not send its own back. It will probably drift away from it over time.
- **What it is not:** it is not an official project and is not affiliated with Activision, Infinity Ward or the author of the original repository. It contains no game files.
