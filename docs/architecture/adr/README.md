# Architecture decision records

One file per decision, `NNNN-title.md`, MADR-lite. An accepted ADR is not
edited: a later ADR supersedes it, and only its Status line changes
(`Superseded by NNNN`). ADRs 0001–0005 record decisions taken before this
folder existed, with the date the decision was made.
